# /data/

Store data files here, except for data required or produced as part of your Notebook rmd.  

**IMPORTANT** Do not store large files here (e.g., raw seq. read files) due to storage limitations in GitHub

Large data files can be stored in the sub-directory /data/data-large/ which has been added to .gitignore
